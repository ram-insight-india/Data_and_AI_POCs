# Internal POC Repository

Welcome to the Internal Proof of Concept (POC) repository! This space is dedicated to collaborative experimentation and solution development based on problem statements shared by me or other team members.

## üìå Purpose

This repository serves as a central place for:

- Sharing problem statements
- Developing and documenting POC solutions
- Encouraging team-wide participation and learning

Each problem statement is designed to explore ideas, test hypotheses, or prototype potential solutions for internal or client use cases.

## üóÇ Repository Structure

Each problem statement will have its own top-level folder in the repository, following this structure:

üìÅ Problem1/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚Üê Contains the problem statement and instructions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ your-name/ ‚Üê Your personal folder with your solution
üìÅ Problem2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ your-name/


### Example

If a problem named **Problem1** is shared, the folder structure should look like this:

üìÅ Problem1/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md ‚Üê This file contains the problem details and what needs to be solved
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ alice/ ‚Üê Alice‚Äôs solution goes here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ bob/ ‚Üê Bob‚Äôs solution goes here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ charlie/ ‚Üê Charlie‚Äôs solution goes here


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please **do not** edit the main `README.md` inside the problem folder. Create your own subfolder and include your solution and any supporting files (scripts, notebooks, docs, etc.) inside it.

## ‚úÖ How to Contribute

1. Check the latest problem folder (e.g., `Problem1/`).
2. Read the `README.md` inside the folder carefully to understand the problem statement.
3. Create a folder using your **name or GitHub username** inside the problem directory.
4. Add your solution and related materials inside your personal folder.
5. Push your changes to a branch and create a PR for review (optional unless stated otherwise).

## üì£ Notes

- This repository is for **learning, prototyping, and innovation** ‚Äî feel free to try creative or unconventional approaches.
- Solutions do **not** have to be perfect; the goal is to ideate, share, and learn.
- Questions or clarifications about the problem can be raised via GitHub Issues or directly with the author.

Happy Hacking! üöÄ
